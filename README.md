# Data Science London + scikit-learn

# Description
Data Science London is hosting a meetup on Scikit-learn.  This competition is a practice ground for trying, sharing, and creating examples of sklearn's classification abilities (if this turns in to something useful, we can follow it up with regression, or more complex classification problems).

We encourage participants to post code via the "Tutorials" link on the left.  Don't worry about accuracy or whether your code is perfect.  The aim here is to explore sklearn by using it. You do not need to use sklearn to enter the competition. If you're new, we hope you'll use this oppurtunity to practice a new tool.  If you're an expert, we hope you'll share the knowledge and document interesting ways to approach this problem.

Scikit-learn (sklearn) is an established, open-source machine learning library, written in Python with the help of NumPy, SciPy and Cython.

Scikit-learn is very user friendly, has a consistent API, and provides extensive documentation. Its implementation is high quality due to strict coding standards and high test coverage.  Behind sklearn is a very active community, which is steadily improving the library.

# Meetup information

"Learning in Python with scikit-learn" by Andreas Mueller

This talk will give an overview of the library and introduce general machine learning concepts such as supervised and unsupervised learning, feature extraction, cross validation for model evaluation and hyper parameter selection. We will also touch some more advanced yet practically useful concepts such as feature hashing and ensemble learning.

Andreas is a PhD student in machine learning an computer vision at Bonn University in Germany. He is one of the core developers and the maintainer of scikit-learn and the author of the blog peekaboo-vision. His interests include principles and applications of machine learning and open science.

"Parallel and large scale learning with scikit-learn" by Olivier Grisel

This talk will give a introduce practical tools and concepts to better leverage multicore machines and small clusters to perform interactive yet scalable predictive modeling with scikit-learn and IPython.parallel. In particular, we will introduce:
- A short introduction to the parallel features of iPython from the notebook interface
- How to perform scalable text feature extraction with the Hashing Trick
- How to parallelize or distribute model evaluation (cross-validation) and hyper-parameter tuning
- How to optimize memory usage with memory mapping
- How to approximate kernel Support Vector Machines for large scale datasets
- A short introduction to Ensembles with model averaging and Random Forests

Olivier is a R&D Software Engineer working in Java by day and a Python machine learning hacker by night. He is interested in applications to Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and predictive modelling.
